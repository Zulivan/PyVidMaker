# Process for Adding Scenery to Videos

Actions in video scripting play a crucial role in enhancing the visual appeal of your content. This guide will explain the process for adding scenery to your videos, using Python scripts and the MoviePy library.

## Overview

In this process, we will create and utilize custom Python scripts that handle audio and video clip generation. These scripts will help us incorporate scenery and effects into our videos to make them more dynamic and engaging. Here's how it works:

## File Structure

- `actions/` (main directory)
  - `add_scenery/` (folder containing the python script and custom image audio files)
    - `add_scenery.py` (Python script for clip generation)
    - `scene_arbitrary_name.png` (Custom file name)

## Python Functions

The Python scripts `audio_generation.py` and `video_generation.py` provide two essential functions for adding scenery to videos:

### `handle_audio_generation(params=[])`

This function is responsible for generating custom audio tracks. You can pass parameters to customize the audio generation process.

### `handle_clip_generation(duration=0, params=[])`

The `handle_clip_generation` function is used to create video clips. You can specify the duration of the clip and pass parameters to customize its appearance and effects.

## Triggering Actions

To use these functions and add scenery to your videos, you'll need to define actions in your script. These actions, along with their corresponding parameters, are triggered within your `story.txt` file. The format for defining actions is as follows:

### `ACTION|add_scenery|beach_background.jpg|sunny_day_audio.wav|duration=10s`

## File Requirements

When creating new actions to add scenery to your videos, keep in mind the following file requirements:

- Audio files must be in WAV format. Ensure that your custom audio files are saved in the `custom_sounds/` folder in WAV format for compatibility with the script.

By following this process and utilizing the provided Python scripts, you can seamlessly incorporate scenery and enhance the visual appeal of your videos.
